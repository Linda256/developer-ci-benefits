# Learning about CI

A long long time ago (about 2 years), I don't know if I was genearally familiar CI and TDD. I had become familiar with writing unit tests and was beginning to enjoy the feedback that unit tests could provide.

## TESTING: Part 1, Unit Tests

Unit Tests test small blocks of code to ensure that what is expected is the result.
Unit tests can provide a lot of help with CI because they can provide developers with feedback about code functionality without having to push/merge/host code.

There are testing frameworks that provide assistance with unit tests. When I started writing tests regularly, I quickly felt overwhelmed. The next slide provides more context into unit testing.
