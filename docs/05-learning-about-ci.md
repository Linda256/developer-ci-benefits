# Learning about CI

A long long time ago (just over 2 years), I was not familiar with CI and TDD (Test Driven Development).

## TESTING: Part 1, Unit Tests

Unit Tests test small blocks of code to ensure that what is expected is the result.
Unit tests provide a lot of help with CI. They define code quality and provide developers with feedback without having to push/merge/host code.

There are testing frameworks that provide assistance with unit tests. When I started writing tests regularly, I quickly felt overwhelmed. The next slide provides more context into unit testing.
