# Safety Checks

Described below are tools that assist in safely checking code before a pull request or merge is submitted. Safety checks can also be incorporated into merges which will be described next.

## Why Safety Checks?

Safety checks can automate review or code quality, code logic, code style, spelling and grammar.

## Defining Code (Type Checkers)

Tools like TypeScript clearly define and communicate code interfaces—not just types!

**note:** TypeScript can seem like another layer of code abstraction or learning—so be gentle on yourself or others if learning is feeling or seeming overwelming. Though, on a team like Dollar Shave Club's frontend, TypeScript has help bridge experience gaps, design team patterns, and assist developers when confused.

## Linting

Linting is the practice of allowing a tool to look for non-standard code issues or patterns.

## Eslint (TS-Lint)

Eslint is a tool that compares a repository's JavaScript against universal standards.

## Stylelint, Markdownlint

Stylelint, Markdownlint, HTMLLint are other tools, like Eslint that compare a repository's code to universal standards.

## Writing, commenting

Tools like [Write good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) can help catch spelling mistakes in documentation. Tools like JSDocs or TypeDocs can assist in writing documentation or add useful hints in Code Editors.

## Committing, merging, communicating

Tools like pre-commit, commit standard tools, Github Templates, and Changelogs greatly help in CI code commiting processes.
