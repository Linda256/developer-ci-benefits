# Communicating Benefits

The main reason why I wanted to write a talk about CI is because of how much it has  helped me to grow as a developer. I read and have seen a lot of content on how to improve as a developer.
Most of the content is great. However, no matter how much developers want to work on improving skill or learningâ€”time can be a blocker or an enabler to goals.
It is common to read about quick keys or tools like Alfred for speeding up workflow but I've found CI is largest enabler or time savings.
