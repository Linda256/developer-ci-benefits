# Talk Summation

In this talk, CI setup and benefits where discussed. There may be a lot of review but the goal of this talk is to provide parity with quick opportunities to speed up developer workflow with CI.

## Reason

This talk acknowleges systems that should be implemented into every repository within a short amount of time of it's conception. However, these systems are often secondary to work that direction afters products—which they should be. If these systems are setup systematically, they're guaranteed to help developers and companies save lots of time and lots of money.

## About the Speaker

This talk was written by Jeff Wainwright—an average Joe developer working at Dollar Shave Club. Since Learning more about CI, he's used it to create and maintain several open source projects, work with the Dollar Shave Club Engineering Team to speed up build and integrate systems. This work has given him more time to improve as an engineer, build more things, and have more life outsite of software. He would love help build more utilities to improve CI and non-code related parts of repositories.
