# Beginning Integration

The last slide's `addsOne` function and assertion, describes the initial foundation of Test Driven Development (TDD). This talk is going to fly past going into detail on TDD to describe CI.

## Starting Integration

Once code is unit tested and the developer is more confident to submit a pull request or merge their code into a master (shared) branch, there are more safety checks to assist them in submitting code.

**Note:** the sentence above assumed that [git]() is being used. Code can be submitted via alternate patterns like FTP or saving within a CMS. In those scenarios unit tests and the integrations below can still be used.

## Safety Checks

Safety Checks like Type Checkers, Linter, Documentation and Git helpers can catch unexpected bugs, define code, fix spelling, and make code more uniform to universal developer patterns.
