# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

## My definition

Continuous Integration is a pattern of programming combining infrastructure, testing, and development practices to safely and confidently push code from development to production continuously.

The definition that I provided includes continuous delivery (CD). CD is not focused in this talk. CD is process of continuously delivering code to production. Although CD is not included in this talk, if CI is done well, it is a great benefit to continuously deliver new code to production.
