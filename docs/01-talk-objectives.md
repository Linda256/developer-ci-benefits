# Talk Objectives

This talk summarizes what continuous integration (CI) is, basic frontend setup, and how it can benefit engineers.

Hopefully this talk will provide context for developers who may not use CI.

Perhaps it will provide other configuration option ideas for developers that use CIâ€”or another perspective.
