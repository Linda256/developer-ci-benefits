# Talk Objectives

This talk summarizes what continuous integration (CI) is, basic frontend setup, and how it can benefit engineers.

Hopefully this talk will provide context for developers who may not use CI.

Perhaps it will provide other configuration option ideas for developers that use CI—or another perspective.

> Testing is one of these things that people don't talk about it a lot because people don't do it. ...People that do do testing are extremely passionate about it—like crossfit. ...I have a feeling a lot of people don't test.

_Paraphrasing [Wes Bos](wesbos.com) from the [Syntax](syntax.fm) podcast on [test](https://syntax.fm/show/040/the-testing-show)_

This quote was chosen because before starting at Dollar Shave Club, I had worked on some decent sized engineering teams and had never written a test—so I get it.

> Releasing software is too often an art; it should be an engineering discipline.

_[David Farley](http://www.davefarley.net/), [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html)

This quote was chosen because it breaks down what can seem mythical into a process that most any person can follow and ship code.




## Continuous Integration

Continuouse Integration is a pattern of programming inolving infrastructure, testing, and development practices that provide companies and developers with the confidence to push code from development right to production.
