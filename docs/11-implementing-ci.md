# CI Configuration Init

Getting CI started for a repository takes minutes or even less! This document will focus on getting setup quickly. More detail will be provided in later documents.

## Starting Integration

Once code is unit tested and the developer is more confident to submit a pull request or merge their code into a master (shared) branch, there are more safety checks to assist them in submitting code.

**Note:** the sentence above assumed that [git]() is being used. Code can be submitted via alternate patterns like FTP or saving within a CMS. In those scenarios unit tests and the integrations below can still be used.

## Safety Checks

Safety Checks like Type Checkers, Linter, Documentation and Git helpers can catch unexpected bugs, define code, fix spelling, and make code more uniform to universal developer patterns.

### Unit Tests

### End to End Tests

### Code Quality Checks

## Automatic Setup

If test commands are already defined, CI can be implemented with no configuration. In a CI tool, like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/), you search for your repository a click a button that is essentiallyâ€”start building with CI.

For JavaScript, CicleCi will look at `test` within a repository's `package.json` to see it valid test script is added. If it is, then CircleCi will begin running CI automatically.

## Very basic setup if Tests are not yet written

If tests aren't yet written, setting up CI can still be implemented. Below, a basic ci setup will be defined for a javascript project.

1. Setup linting.
   - npm install eslint --save-dev
   - within `package.json` add an eslint script, in example `"eslint:ci": "eslint ."`
1. Setup a CI configuration file
   - within a shell run `mkdir .circleci && touch .circleci/config.yml`
   - Add the following to the file:

     ```yml

      defaults: &defaults
        working_directory: ~/code
        docker:
          - image: circleci/node:10
            environment:
              NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL: error # make npm commands less noisy
              JOBS: max # https://gist.github.com/ralphtheninja/f7c45bdee00784b41fed
      version: 2
      jobs:
        build:
          <<: *defaults
          steps:
            - checkout
            - run: npm i
            - run: npm run eslint:ci

     ```

After those 2 steps CircleCi should pick up the `.circleci/config.yml`.

## Why is setting up even basic CI so important?

Setting up CI even with the most basic setup is extremely beneficial for time saving and code quality!

Two featured that can save developers hours per week with such small CI featuring are automatic dependency updates and build testing. These features will be discussed further in other documents.
